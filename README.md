# ZakiDLP (A GUI for yt-dlp)
- It's a GUI based on yt-dlp -a cli program that downloads from [various websites](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

## Features
- Currently, my app works fine with YouTube, SoundCould, for a single media or a playlist.
- To pause the downloading, just close the app :)
- To resume whenever you want, just choose same settings, and it will continue from where it stopped.
- For the same file, you can't download it with different qualities, as the tool `yt-dlp` see that it is the same, instead rename the old one and it will download the new one.
- For video that is in a playlist -you can download the full playlist using this link as if it were the playlist link
###  For single media,
  - For audio
    - I"ll show you all available audio options
  -  For video
      - I'll show you `first`: videos that has already auido in it, `second`: the highest and lowest size for each quality that has no audio, and I'll merge the best audio file with it
      - There is a horizontal line between them

### For playlists    
  - For videos
    - I'll show you the usual list ("144", "240", "360", "480", "720", "1080"), and I'll try to download with that quality, each video quality will be printed to you

- Over time I will add more websites with more features inshallah.
